	Our goal at Rathwood's Experience website is to make your purchasing experience easy and efficient, so we can get you on your way to our Rathwood Event as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
	The following Purchase Policies are designed to ensure your satisfaction and understanding of the purchase process for Rathwood Event Experience. The following are the rules or "Terms and Conditions" that govern use of the Rathwood Event website.
</p>

<p>
	By using or visiting this website (hereinafter "Site"), you expressly agree to be bound by these Terms and to follow these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations governing this web site. Rathwood Home & Garden World Ltd, hereinafter "Rathwood" and their respective affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively "Rathwood") reserve the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any time, effective immediately upon posting on this web site. Please check this page of the website periodically.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Rathwood's Purchase Policy:</b>
<br>

	When you pay for your ticket booking online by laser, credit or debit card, you will automatically receive an email by return to the email address you entered. It is therefore important that you enter your email address correctly.
</p>

	<ul>
		<li>This email will give you instructions on how to print your ticket if you need to.</li>
		<li>You must bring your printed Ticket with you on the day of your event or be able to produce your ticket on your phone. There will be a barcode on this Ticket and admittance will not be permitted without the Ticket.</li>
		<li>When you arrive at Rathwood, present your Ticket at the Check-in desk up to 30 minutes before your event is due to start and you will receive your sticker passes in.</li>
		<li>Keep your Ticket and sticker passes with you at all times as you may be asked for them during your event.</li>
	</ul>
<br>

<p>
	Please remember, all purchases are subject to laser/debit/credit card authorisation and billing address verification, which may take place after initial confirmation has been given. Tickets purchased on the Rathwood website may be subject to a non-refundable laser/debit/credit card charge.
<br>

	It is advised that you collect your admittance passes a minimum of 30 minutes in advance of your chosen event time. Regrettably Tickets and Passes cannot be posted out.
<br>

	If your chosen event time is cancelled or rescheduled by Rathwood, we will endeavour to contact you either by phone, e-mail or letter with the contact details you provided at the time of booking.
<br>

	Therefore it is very important that you give two different contact numbers when you are booking your tickets.
<br>

	Occasionally, additional Tickets may be available prior to or during the period of the event, however the availability and timing of these additional tickets maybe outside the control of Rathwood.
<br>

	For queries about a purchase you have made, please email info@rathwood.com, quoting the Ticket reference number printed on your emailed paid Ticket.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Cancellation Option:</b>
<br>
	If you availed of the Cancellation Option when booking your tickets and you now wish to cancel or transfer your tickets to another date, please email your request to cancellations@rathwood.com. Please note that you cannot claim a refund on or transfer of part of your ticket i.e. only full ticket cancellations and transfers can be made for your full ticket.
<br>

	Please state your Ticket reference number, the name your tickets were booked under, your reason for cancelling or transferring and a daytime contact number.
<br>

	You must email your request to cancellations@rathwood.com before the cancellation date and time stated on your Ticket. Please note once you have submitted a valid cancellation email it cannot be withdrawn.
<br>

	You will be offered an alternative date and time, if one is available and a refund of your tickets less charges if another date and time is not available.
<br>

	If you submit a cancellation AFTER this date and time, you will NOT be entitled to any refund. 
<br>
 

<b>Note: No refunds will be made for:</b>
</p>
<ul>

	<li>(a) Cancellations where the Cancellation Option has not been purchased</li>

	<li>(b) Cancellations after the Cancellation Date and Time printed on your ticket, where you have paid for the cancellation option</li>

	<li>(c) Cancellations must only be submitted to the email address (cancellations@rathwood.com) or they will be considered invalid and no refund will be made.</li>

	<li>(d) Part of a ticket where only some of your group cannot attend. The Cancellation Option applies to the full ticket only.</li>
</ul>
